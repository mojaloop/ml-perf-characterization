# FSPIOP Agreement Performance Characterization

## Status

| Mojaloop Version |  Date  | Status  | Next  | Notes  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 15.1.0* | 2023-10-08 | **The `FSPIOP-Agreement` has achieved a maximum observed End-to-end throughput of around `274 Op/s` @ `51.2 ms` duration based on [Test-Scenario](#scenarios) `#9` results, with the following configuration:**<br> 1. Machine: AWS m6i.4xlarge, 16 CPU 3.5 GHz, 64gb RAM, iO2 SSD 5k-25k iOPS <br> 2. DSPs: 2 <br> 3. Container Scaling: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 3x for Quoting Service <br><br>**An overview of the configuration and code changes made over all [Test-Scenario](#scenarios) are summarized as follows:** <br> 1. Reduced logging to debug and fixed log level checking**Caching** on **Central-Ledger** (ref: [Test-Scenarios](#scenarios) **#1**,**#4**) ~ `7 Op/s` ðŸ”¼ <br> | See [#follow-up-stores](#follow-up-stories) |   |

* Test version is based on ML 15.1.0 but metric additions and initial code changes
  were needed before performance testing could be started.

## Test Scenarios

### Assumptions

- Use In-Memory DB for all the scenarios to rule out disk I/O issues
- Default is random 2 DFSPs as payer and payee from the configurable pool
- The following AWS machine was used for testing: `m6i.4xlarge`
  - `16x` vCPU - `3.5 GHz` 3rd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors (Ice Lake 8375C)
  - `64gb` RAM
  - HDD `io2` with `50`-`100` GB, @ `5k`-`25k` iOP/S is used unless otherwise stated (_i.e. 5k iOP/s configured from Scenario 51+ onwards_)
- Docker Version ([ref](https://gist.github.com/mdebarros/6d9ac90f33c96031cbce6b9a3ea8048e))

### Approach

The approach taken for characterization is follows:

#### 0. Tools Used

Refer to [../README.md#4-tools-used](../README.md#4-tools-used) for more information.

#### 1. Setup Tests, Test-Scenarios & ml-core-test-harness

Initially setup the ml-core-test-harness to support the [Test Scenarios](#test-scenarios) described above. This is done by setting removing all externalized dependencies by simulating them with a simulator (also known as the "Callback Handler Service").

Refer to the following diagram showing the FSPIOP-Agreement characterization interaction diagram:

![fspiop-agreement-characterization-end-to-end](../assets/images/fspiop-agreement-characterization-end-to-end.drawio.png)

#### 2. Capturing End-to-end Metrics

Refer to [../README#capturing-end-to-end-metrics](../README.md#2-capturing-end-to-end-metrics) for more information.

#### 2. Validate Tests, Test-Scenarios & ml-core-test-harness

Once this has been established the next step is to validate the ml-core-test-harness, and the [Test Cases](#test-cases) by executing a [Smoke test](../README.md#3-types-of-tests).

#### 3. Baseline without the Target Service

A baseline without the target service (Quoting service) was skipped since testing using only externalized Simulators was done in fspiop-transfer testing.
Past baselines have shown that the simulators are not a limiting factor/
This is shown in the following diagram, the same diagram as before except with the ML-API-Adapter and Central-Ledger services and handlers being removed:

#### 4. Execute a Tests with the Target Service based on Test Scenarios

This stage we execute the actual Test Scenarios, capture results, and document any observations and findings as a results.

Here we would execute any combination of the following tests based on the [Test Scenarios](#test-scenarios):

1. Average-Load
2. Stress
3. Spike
4. Breakpoint

## Follow-up stories


| Story | Name | Description | Impact | Issue | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Re-enable caching on getParticipant and getParticipantEndpoint | Caching for participants and their endpoints should improve quote performance. https://github.com/mojaloop/project/issues/3565 | High | | |
| 2 | Quoting service stalls on large concurrent requests/loads | Quoting service stalls on high concurrency (around 20+ VU), this is an investigation and followup fix https://github.com/mojaloop/project/issues/3564 | High | | |
